Microservice Documentation
1. Application Architecture Style
Implementing Vertical Slice Architecture:

Organize code into feature folders, each encapsulating a single feature in a .cs file.

2. Patterns and Principles
Utilizing several patterns and principles:

CQRS Pattern: Segregates operations into commands (writes) and queries (reads).

Mediator Pattern: Centralizes message mediation for better decoupling.

DI in ASP.NET Core: Dependency Injection for loose coupling and testability.

Minimal API and Routing in ASP.NET: Lightweight APIs for better performance.

3. Libraries and NuGet Packages
Key libraries and packages used:

MediatR: For implementing the mediator pattern.

Carter: Simplifies API endpoint creation.

Marten: ORM for PostgreSQL, enhancing data management.

Mapster: Object mapping library for seamless transformations.

Fluent Validation: Provides robust input validation.

4. Folder Structure
Organized into essential folders:

Model: Contains data models.

Features: Feature-specific code organized by functionality.

Data: Data access layer, integrating with ORM.

Abstractions: Interfaces and abstractions for dependency inversion.
